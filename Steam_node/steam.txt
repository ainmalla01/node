 Next Topic: Streams in Node.js
Streams are an essential part of handling I/O operations in Node.js.
 They allow you to read or write data in chunks,
 which is much more efficient than reading or writing the entire file or data at once. 
 This is especially useful for dealing with large files, network requests, or databases.
 What are Streams?
A Stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data. 
There are four main types of streams in Node.js:

Readable Streams: Used for reading data (e.g., reading from a file or HTTP response).

Writable Streams: Used for writing data (e.g., writing to a file or HTTP request).

Duplex Streams /(piping stream): Both readable and writable (e.g., TCP sockets).

Transform Streams: A type of duplex stream that can modify the data as itâ€™s written and read 
(e.g., zlib compression streams).
